# Overview

My name is Knighten Cooper and I am studying to be a software engineer. I wanted to get practice with Java so 
I made a simple financial planning app. This project helped me to learn some basic syntax and get experience 
with java.

My app uses a command-line interface to ask a user if they want to set a savings goal, calculate simple interest,
or calculation compound interest. The app then collects the user's information and tells them how much their 
investment will be worth or how much they need to save each month to reach their savings goal. The app utilizes
functions, loops, classes, variables, an ArrayList, conditionals, and expressions.

My purpose in writing this software was to get experience with Java. I have experience with Python and was curious
to see how the two languages differ and are similar. Doing this project taught me lots about Java.

I used the Java language and
