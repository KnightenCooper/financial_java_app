# Overview

My name is Knighten Cooper and I am studying to be a software engineer. I wanted to get practice with Java so 
I made a simple financial planning app. This project helped me to learn some basic syntax and get experience 
with Java.

My app uses a command-line interface to ask a user if they want to set a savings goal, calculate simple interest,
or calculation compound interest. The app then collects the user's information and tells them how much their 
investment will be worth or how much they need to save each month to reach their savings goal. The app utilizes
functions, loops, classes, variables, an ArrayList, conditionals, and expressions.

My purpose in writing this software was to get experience with Java. I have experience with Python and was curious
to see how the two languages differ and are similar. Doing this project taught me lots about Java.

# Development Environment

I started on an online IDE called Replit, and then moved to Vs Code. I liked the simplicity of using Replit but it's very slow.

I used the Java language and the Scanner and ArrayList imports.

# Future Work

* I would like to change the outputs so they only have 2 decimal places. The numbers represent money so 2 decimal
places makes more sense.
* I would love to implement a GUI. The command-line interface works but isn't ver user friendly.
* It would be amazing if I could connect this with a banking API and utilize a user's actual information to 
make calculations.
